# Simple yet awesome game:

# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Introduction
Welcome to a simple text-based version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe (X and O) game in Python. This game is designed for two players to take turns and compete in the timeless strategy game.

## How to Play
To start playing the game, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Game:**
   - Execute the Python script, typically by opening your terminal or command prompt and navigating to the game's directory. Then, run the script using `python tictactoe.py`.

2. **Game Board:**
   - You will see a 3x3 grid representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

3. **Player's Moves:**
   - Players take turns making moves.
   - To make a move, enter the desired location on the board as `row, column`. For instance, to place your symbol in the top-right corner, input `0, 2`.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - The game continues until one player wins or the board is full (a tie).
   - To win, a player must get three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

5. **Game Over:**
   - If a player wins, the game will display a message declaring them as the winner.
   - If the board is full and no player wins, the game ends in a tie.

6. **Replay:**
   - If you'd like to play another round, simply restart the game by running the script again.

## Game Rules
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on the grid.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If the grid is full and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

## Customization
Feel free to customize the game according to your preferences. You can modify the Python code to:

- Change the symbols (use different characters for X and O).
- Adjust the appearance of the game board.
- Add new features or game modes.
- Expand the grid size (e.g., 4x4 or 5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe).

## Dependencies
